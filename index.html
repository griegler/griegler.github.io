<h1>About</h1>

I am a research scientist at the Intelligent Systems Lab (Intel) lead by <a href="http://vladlen.info/">Vladlen Koltun</a>. 
My current research focuses on 3D reconstruction, image-based rendering, and photorealism with an emphasize on how to efficiently utilize latest deep learning techniques to push the current state-of-the-art.
In addition, I am actively contributing to <a href="http://www.open3d.org/">Open3D</a>.
In 2017, I finished my PhD at Graz University of Technology with a focus on deep learning for 2.5D and 3D under the supervision of <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/research/team-bischof/people/team-about/horst-bischof">Horst Bischof</a>. 
During my PhD I spent time at Amazon Prime Air and at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, where I worked with <a href="http://www.cvlibs.net/">Andreas Geiger</a> on efficient deep learning for 3D.
