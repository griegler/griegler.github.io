Deep learning based method are revolutionizing many fields in computer science, especially in computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing. 
These methods have in common that they learn a hierarchy of non-linear feature extractors together with a classifier, or regressor in an end-to-end fashion.
Although the underlying concepts, especially artificial neural networks and the backpropagation algorithm, are several decades old, they came to new importance mainly due to today's sheer amount of available data and parallel compute power, i.e., GPGPUs.
The applications in computer vision mainly focus on recognition tasks on natural images which are 2D projections of the world.
In contrast, in this thesis we propose methods that investigate deep learning specifically for 2.5D and 3D data.
